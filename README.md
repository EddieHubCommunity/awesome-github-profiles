## How can I add my GitHub profile? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/awesome-github-profiles/issues), with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customised GitHub profile page (copy the generated image URL, this will be needed in the next step). The URL will look something like this `https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/awesome-github-profiles/assets/51878265/ee31b832-d549-4df9-8ffe-24419f9d0e46`

3. Fork the project, using the top right corner button, that states `fork`

4. Create a file named `your-username.json` in the directory [`profiles`](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/awesome-github-profiles/tree/main/profiles) with the following content.

> <span style="color: #606c71">Your entry should be similar to this example:</span>

  "issueId": 66,
  "name": "Eddie Jaoude",
  "username": "eddiejaoude"
}
```

4. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/awesome-github-profiles/pulls) to add the changes to this repository. Please change the title to `fix: add <your-username>` and in the description add `closes #issueNumber`
