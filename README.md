## How can I add my GitHub profile? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/awesome-github-profiles/issues), with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customised GitHub profile page (copy the generated image URL, this will be needed in the next step)

2. Fork the project, using the top right corner button, that states `fork`

3. Create a file named `your-username.json` in the directory [`profiles`](/profiles) with the following content. 

>  Your entry should be similar to this example:

```json
{
    "image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/91057573-48531300-e61f-11ea-9e13-2d7384e42000.png",
    "issueId": 66,
    "name": "Eddie Jaoude",
    "username": "eddiejaoude"
}
```

4. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/awesome-github-profiles/pulls) to add the changes to this repository. Please change the title to `add your-username` and in the description add `resolve #issueNumber`
