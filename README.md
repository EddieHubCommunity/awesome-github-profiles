List of GitHub profiles that have awesome customisation, that you can use for inspiration.\
Feel free to submit a pull request with your suggestions of awesome GitHub profiles.

## How can I add my GitHub profile?

1. Create an issue, with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customised GitHub profile page (copy the generated image URL, this will be needed in the next step)

2. Fork the project

3. In the `data.json` file, add your own object to the end of the file. Your entry should be similar to this example:

```json
{
    "name": "Eddie Jaoude",
    "githubUsername": "eddiejaoude",
    "imageUrl": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/91057573-48531300-e61f-11ea-9e13-2d7384e42000.png",
    "issueNumber": 66
}
```

**Note** : Please do not edit anything below `<!--START_SECTION:data-section-->` in `profiles.md`. Our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/gh-action-community) will make the necessary changes for you.

4. Create a Pull Request to add the changes to this Repository. Please change the title to `add your-username` and in the description add `resolve #issueNumber`
